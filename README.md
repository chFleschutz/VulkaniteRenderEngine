## Introduction

Vulkanite Render Engine is a simple rendering engine built as an exercise in preparation for my upcoming bachelor's thesis. It leverages the power of the Vulkan Graphics API for rendering, aiming to provide a foundation for advanced graphics programming. Please note that this project is a work in progress and will be continually developed alongside my thesis work.
